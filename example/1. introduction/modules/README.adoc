# 1.1 Modules

`Welcome to the modules tab!`

### 1. What is a module ?

A module in batr is the program name. You can simply create a file such as `start.batr`

`start.batr`

    module Start

In the given code you can see two things: 

* the first step is to give a name to your program by writing `module Start`. This will
name your program window `Start`

TIP: There can only be one `module` defined per file!

* the second step in each program is to write a `main method`, which will lead to:


### 2. How to write a program using batter?

Now you will learn how to write your first program.

`(taken from start.batr)`

    module Start
    &nbsp;
    main <
        s:text = "Hello World!"
        print(text)
    >

As you can see, to define the main method you will only have to write `main`, but additionally you will have
to give your main method a scope. This scope will be defined by `< >`. Those symbols will also be used for all
other scopes in this language.
