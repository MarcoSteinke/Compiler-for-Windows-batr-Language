# 1.1 Modules

Welcome to the modules tab!

### What is a module ?

A module in batr is the program name. I want batr to be a better version of the windows batch scripting. I have written a lot
of automizations and small programs for 8 years now. Windows batch scripting brought me into programming and always followed me.


I have written code for personal use and also created things with batch which were used in a business with around 550 employees
and guaranteed to backup their documents and make flexible work possible due to de-coupling of a employer from a certain device
and make them able to continue their work on any other device.
