# 2. Data Types

In this document you will learn the most important things about `data types` in batter

## Why do we need Data Types?

Since `batter` will be interpreted and translated to `windows batch` code, it is not neccessary to implement
`data types`, but on the other side this makes the `implementation of data types` very easy, since we can reduce
them to windows batch variables.

With this, we can now introduce some `data Types`, which will guarantee `type-safe programming` and reduce the
amount of mysterious bugs such as in Python or Javascript.

.Data Types
|===
|Type |Definition |Explanation

|Integer
|i:number = 4
|All positive and negative whole numbers

|Double
|d:number = 7.2
|All real numbers


|char

|All unicode-characters

|String
|s:name = "Linus"

|Boolean
|b:is_valid = true
|Logical true of false

## How to use them?
In this subdirectory are some `example`s which show `standard implementations` to demonstrate
the use of `Data Types` in `batter`. The HelloWorld-example in chapter 1 `modules` also was such
an example for strings.
