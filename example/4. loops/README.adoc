# 4. Loops

After you have learned about `data types` and `conditional programming` you will now be able to `make decisions`, or let
your code do so. Therefore I will now introduce loops.

To start with, in general there are two certain types of loops.

## 4.1 FOR-Loops:

If you want to run a piece of code for a number of parameters you could first think of something like:

    main {
        i:number = 1
        print(number)
        print(number+1)
        print(number+2)   
    }

#### Result:
    1
    2
    3


But that is a lot of work to do and absolutely not flexible code. It is called "hard-coding".
