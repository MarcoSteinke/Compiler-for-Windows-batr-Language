# 4. Loops

After you have learned about `data types` and `conditional programming` you will now be able to `make decisions`, or let
your code do so. Therefore I will now introduce loops.

To start with, in general there are two certain types of loops.

If you want to run a piece of code for a number of parameters you could first think of something like:

    main {
        i:number = 1
        print(number)
        print(number+1)
        print(number+2)   
    }

#### Result:
    1
    2
    3


But that is a lot of work to do and absolutely not flexible code. It is called "hard-coding".

To avoid something like this, we will have to use:

## 4.1 FOR-Loops:

A FOR-loop is a loop which has the following:

`Iterator`: A variable which will be iterated inside of the loop.

`starting value`: The value at which the iterator starts.

`termination condition`: A boolean expression which determines when the loop has to stop.

`iteration step`: This step defines what will happen to the iterator after each iteration.

Now you will find an example which shows a FOR-loop in `batter`:

    for(i:i = 1, i <= 20, i++) {
        print(i)
    }

To give a better explanation of the code, please read the following definition:

`Iterator`: `i:i` An integer called i.

`starting value`: `i:i = 1` The iterator i starts at 1.

`termination condition`: `i <= 20` Iterate while i is smaller or equal to 20.

`iteration step`: `i++` Increase i by 1 after each iteration.
