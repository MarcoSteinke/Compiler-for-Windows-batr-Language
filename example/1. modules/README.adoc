# 1. Modules

`Welcome to the modules tab!`

### 1. What is a module ?

A `module` in batr is the `program name`. You can simply create a file such as `start.batr`

`start.batr`

    module Start

In the given code you can see two things: 

* the `first step` is to give a name to your program by writing `module Start`. This will
name your program window `Start`

TIP: There can only be one `module` defined per file!

* the second step in each program is to write a `main method`, which will lead to:


### 2. How to write a program using batter?

Now you will learn how to write your first program.

`(taken from start.batr)`

    module Start
     
    main <
        s:text = "Hello World!"
        print(text)
    >

As you can see, to define the `main method` you will only have to write `main`, but additionally you will have
to give your main method a scope. This scope will be defined by `< >`. Those symbols will also be used for all
`other scopes` in this language.

The next thing you can see inside is the implementation of a `simple Hello-World-program`. If you know this, you can now

`Otherwise you can continue reading this document!`

In most programming languages, the first example you will face is `Hello World`. It is a simple task to create a program
which is able to print "Hello World!" to your Terminal, because it requires you to be able to compile code and to understand
the entry point of a program.

#### Example of Hello World in Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

This program defines the entry-point of a `Java class` and demonstrates how to print text to the terminal.

Instead of `classes`, I want to use `modules` in `batter`. In general, they shall have the same properties.

At this point I am not sure if there will be fully working objects in batter.
