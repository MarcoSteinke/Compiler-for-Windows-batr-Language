# 3. Conditional programming (conditions)

I want to proudly present you my currently favorite part of this documentation.

You will now learn how to control the flow of your program by using conditions.

TIP: You will need to know about the boolean data type now

## What are conditions?

In programming, you want your program to do certain steps in condition to 
certain behaviour or states. Thatswhy you will end up using conditions to
control your program.
