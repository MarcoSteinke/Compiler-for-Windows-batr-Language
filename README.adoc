# Windows-batter-Language
An improvement to the Windows bat scripting. Just making the things "batter"

    module Numbers
    main {
        i:first_number = 5
        i:second_number = 8
        i:result = first_number + second_number
        print(result)
    }

## What is the purpose of this project?

I want batr to be a better version of the windows batch scripting. I have written a lot
of automizations and small programs for 8 years now. Windows batch scripting brought me into programming and always followed me.


I have written code for personal use and also created things with batch which were used in a business with around 550 employees
and guaranteed to backup their documents and make flexible work possible due to de-coupling of a employer from a certain device
and make them able to continue their work on any other device.
